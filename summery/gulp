*** Gulp summary:
=================================
> Install Gulp globally and locally
> Under the project directory create a file
  called 'gulpfile.js'
> under gulpfile.js file import all
  packages like gulp, scss, minify, etc
> Define task() which has Task name, 'src', 'pipe' and 'dist'
  'src'  => source files for the task
  'pipe' => define all the task
  'dist' => processed files destination directory
> End of all we define task() contain 'series'
  for above the task.
  'series' => Using this all tasks will run using
  single command.

Gulp interview:
=================================
Gulp:
1. What is Gulp?
   Gulp is a task runner that automates repetitive tasks.
   Using gulp we can compile SCSS, minify image, js and css file etc.
   
2. How do you install Gulp?
   > npm i -g gulp-cli (globally)
   use: 
   This installs the gulp command globally, allowing you to use   
   the gulp command in your terminal from any directory.
   note: command-line interface (CLI)
   
   > npm i -D gulp (locally)
   This install gulp locally
   
3. Why we should install globally and locally?
   > npm i -g gulp-cli Install Gulp command line globally 
   > npm i -D gulp, using this we can use any version of gulp 
     on our different project.
     
4. What is a Gulpfile?
   > All gulp task define on gulpfile.
   
5. List of some Gulp plugins you have used.
   gulp-sass: Compiles Sass (SCSS) files into CSS.
   gulp-autoprefixer: add prefixer like -webkit-, -moz-
   gulp-rename: Renames files to xyz.min
   gulp-sourcemaps : Creates source maps for your CSS and JavaScript files, 
   helping you debug the original source code in the browser.
   gulp-minify/gulp-uglify: Reduces the size of JavaScript files by removing unnecessary whitespace and code.
   gulp-plumber: Keeps Gulp tasks running even when errors are encountered, making debugging easier.
   del: Deletes files and directories before generate new file and directories.
   gulp-clean-css: Compresses CSS files to reduce file size, improving performance.
   gulp-images-resizer: Adjusts image dimensions as needed, ex: 20X20 for thumbnail.
   gulp-imagemin: Reduces the size of image files without losing quality, improving loading times.
   gulp-webp: Converts images to WebP format.
   browser-sync: Automatically reloads the browser whenever files change
   
6. Similar task runner
   Grunt
   
7. Best use case in Gulp.
   > SCSS compile
   > minify css, js
   > optimize images

9. How do you handle errors in Gulp tasks?
   > we can use plugin like gulp-plumber   
   
10. Explain how to create a Gulp task that depends on other tasks?
    > Use gulp.series
